Learning Edge is a web application for online learning platform. This is the best application for the students to find everything related to studies under a same page. Students can easily access its modules on clicking on widgets which is self- explanatory.

Student will be prompted to sign up/ sign in the website. This application will help the students to see the detailed syllabus of their subjects. And according to the syllabus, students need not to run to library for the study material. This application will help students to get details of name of the books associated to all the subjects, and also provide the videos of the lecture in both English and Hindi languages so that it provides the choice to the student, however he/she wants to learn it.

Apart from the curriculum subjects, our application seems more informative for the students who want to prepare for competitive exams, we provide a General Knowledge module which will help students to get an idea of the competitive questions. It will also show the teachers name associated to the subjects so that students feel free to know about the respective teachers and clear their doubts.
